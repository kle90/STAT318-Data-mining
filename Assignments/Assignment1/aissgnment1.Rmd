Question 2:
a)
```{}
## Normal plots

x = seq(-4,5,length=100)
plot(x,
	0.69*dnorm(x),
	pch=21,
	col="blue",
	cex=0.6,
	lwd = 4,
	type="l",
	xlab = "x",
	ylab = "pi_k*f_k",
	main = "Conditional densities multiplied by prior probabilities")
points(x,
	(1 - 0.69)*dnorm(x,1,0.5),
	pch=21,
	col="red",
	cex=0.6,
	lwd = 4,
	type="l")
legend("topright",
	legend = c("Class 0", "Class 1"),
	col = c("blue","red"),
	lwd = 4,
	text.col = "black",
	horiz = FALSE)
```
b)

Question 3
a)
```{}
## STAT318/462 kNN regression function

kNN <- function(k,x.train,y.train,x.pred) {
# 
## This is kNN regression function for problems with
## 1 predictor
#
## INPUTS
#
# k       = number of observations in nieghbourhood 
# x.train = vector of training predictor values
# y.train = vector of training response values
# x.pred  = vector of predictor inputs with unknown
#           response values 
#
## OUTPUT
#
# y.pred  = predicted response values for x.pred

## Initialize:
n.pred <- length(x.pred);		y.pred <- numeric(n.pred)

## Main Loop
for (i in 1:n.pred){
  d <- abs(x.train - x.pred[i])
  dstar = d[order(d)[k]]
  y.pred[i] <- mean(y.train[d <= dstar])		
}
## Return the vector of predictions
invisible(y.pred)
}
```

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
